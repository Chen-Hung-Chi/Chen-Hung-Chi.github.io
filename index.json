It felt like a great opportunity, so I jumped at the chance!\nMy Interview Process According to what I found online, Affirm’s interview process typically consists of four stages. I’m currently in the first stage, and I’ll break it down below:\nAffirm Interview Stages Initial Screening (Current Stage)\nThis is where I am right now! It started with the recruiter reaching out on LinkedIn. After I submitted my resume, we scheduled a call to discuss my background, skills, and interest in Affirm. It’s mostly about getting to know each other and seeing if there’s a good fit. Technical Assessment\nFrom what I’ve read, this stage usually involves a coding challenge or technical exercise to evaluate my problem-solving and programming skills. I’m preparing for this next step! Technical Interviews\nThis stage seems to involve deeper technical discussions, likely with engineers from the team. I expect it’ll include coding problems, system design questions, or a dive into my past projects. Final Round (Behavioral + Team Fit)\nThe last stage appears to focus on cultural fit and behavioral questions. I might meet with senior team members or managers to talk about my experience, values, and how I’d contribute to Affirm. A Few Thoughts I’ll keep updating this as I progress through the stages. If anyone has tips for interviewing with Affirm, I’d love to hear them!
