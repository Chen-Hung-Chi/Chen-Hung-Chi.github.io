[{"content":"Introduction Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Hung-Chi! Originally from Taiwan, I\u0026rsquo;ve recently relocated to Toronto and am eager to start my professional journey here in Canada. With over three years of experience as a back-end developer specializing in Java, I\u0026rsquo;ve developed extensive expertise in building and optimizing APIs, managing databases, and integrating third-party services.\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently seeking opportunities to contribute my skills, collaborate with passionate teams, and continue growing as a developer. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a dedicated and experienced Java engineer, I\u0026rsquo;d love to connect!\nFeel free to reach out—let\u0026rsquo;s chat about how I can add value to your team.\nTechnical Skills Languages: Java Frontend: Vue.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript Frameworks \u0026amp; Libraries: Spring Boot, MyBatis API Development: RESTful API, OpenAPI Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Redis Messaging \u0026amp; Streaming: Kafka DevOps \u0026amp; Tools: Gitlab, Docker, Jenkins, Ansible Monitoring: ELK Stack, Grafana Project Management: Jira, Confluence ","permalink":"https://chen-hung-chi.github.io/post/about-me/","summary":"Introducing myself as a Java back-end developer.","title":"About Me"},{"content":"Deloitte Role Java Developer - Operate\nHow It Srarted I submitted my resume directly to Deloitte via LinkedIn, drawn by how closely the industry aligns with my university major and previous work experience. This field is one I’m familiar with and passionate about, making it a natural fit for my background.\nInterview Process The first round of the interview was conducted through a digital interview format. The questions were designed to assess various aspects of my skills and experience, with a mix of different question types. Based on my notes, the breakdown of the question formats was as follows:\n2 video response questions 11 written (typed) responses 3 multiple-choice questions 1 multi-select question I recorded three specific typed-answer questions that stood out during the process:\nExplain why your background and experience would be a good fit for this job. Tell us what has been your best work achievement to this point in your career. What made this achievement important? Describe a difficult task you were faced with and how you addressed it. A Few Thoughts This was my first interview conducted entirely in English, so I felt quite nervous throughout the process.\nThe limited preparation time—only one minute to think and a single chance to re-record—made it challenging to deliver my answers naturally, especially for the video responses. I suspect I didn’t perform as well as I could have in those sections.\nHowever, I believe my written (typed) responses were relatively strong, as I had more time to organize my thoughts.\nDespite this, I ultimately received a rejection email, which was disappointing. Still, the experience taught me a valuable lesson: I need to significantly improve my English-speaking skills.\nMoving forward, I see this as an opportunity to grow and better prepare for future interviews.\nAffirm Role Software Engineer II (Merchant Data Platform)\nHow It Started I was directly contacted by a recruiter from Affirm via LinkedIn, who invited me to submit my resume. It felt like a great opportunity, so I jumped at the chance!\nInterview Process According to what I found online, Affirm’s interview process typically consists of four stages. I’m currently in the first stage, and I’ll break it down below:\nAffirm Interview Stages Initial Screening (Completed – Moving to Next Stage)\n2025/03/07 It started with the recruiter reaching out on LinkedIn. After I submitted my resume, we scheduled a call to discuss my background, skills, and interest in Affirm. It’s mostly about getting to know each other and seeing if there’s a good fit.\n2025/03/14 Progress Update: Moving forward in the process! Interview Summary:\nToday at noon, I had my initial screening interview with the recruiter on Zoom. Luckily, the camera wasn’t required, which helped ease my nerves a bit. As a non-native English speaker, I was quite anxious, so I prepared a list of potential questions in advance.\nAt the beginning of the call, I greeted the recruiter briefly. He seemed very nice, but he spoke quite fast, which made me even more nervous. I mentioned that I had some notes prepared, and he was okay with it. I then proceeded with my self-introduction.\nQuestions Asked:\nWhat are you looking for in this role? What are your salary expectations? Do you have any questions for us? Additionally, he explained that they are looking for a candidate with Java experience and some understanding of Python.\nIt was a nerve-wracking experience, but I’m glad I prepared! Now, I’m looking forward to the next steps.\nTechnical Assessment\nFrom what I’ve read, this stage usually involves a coding challenge or technical exercise to evaluate my problem-solving and programming skills. I’m preparing for this next step! Technical Interviews\nThis stage seems to involve deeper technical discussions, likely with engineers from the team. I expect it’ll include coding problems, system design questions, or a dive into my past projects. Final Round (Behavioral + Team Fit)\nThe last stage appears to focus on cultural fit and behavioral questions. I might meet with senior team members or managers to talk about my experience, values, and how I’d contribute to Affirm. A Few Thoughts I’ll keep updating this as I progress through the stages. If anyone has tips for interviewing with Affirm, I’d love to hear them!

As a newcomer, I wanted to sharpen my English and settle into this bustling city quickly. That’s when I stumbled upon the University of Toronto’s School of Continuing Studies’ English for Effective Communication course. It ended up being a fantastic choice—not just for practical skills but also for easing into life here. Here’s my experience as a newbie in Toronto.\nWhy I Chose This Course Arriving fresh in Toronto, I needed something to boost my English and help me connect with the city. UofT’s course caught my eye with its practical approach and the bonus of student perks—ideal for someone like me still finding my footing.\nWhat I Got Out of It TCard and Library Access One unexpected perk was receiving a TCard (UofT’s student ID). It opened the doors to the university’s libraries—perfect for studying or simply soaking in the campus vibe.\nStudent Discounts The course also qualified me for a Post-Secondary Student ID, which let me snag a discounted Presto card for monthly transit. That saved me a chunk of change on Toronto’s buses and subways. Plus, I scored 10% off at some supermarkets—a lifesaver for a budget-conscious newcomer.\nNew Connections I took the course from February to March, a busy season for Japanese exchange students. I met many of them, along with some Koreans and Colombians (apparently, January had more Koreans). The group was diverse, but language barriers made deep connections tough unless you lucked out with fluent speakers.\nThe Course Experience The instructors were patient and great at teaching real-world English skills—like speaking confidently or drafting professional emails—which I desperately needed in Toronto.\nThe classes were solid, but the after-class activities fell short.\nWith so many Japanese students struggling with English, they often switched to Japanese, limiting chances for meaningful chats. That was a bit disappointing.\nHow to Join Signing up is easy: head to the course page, check the schedule and fees, and register online. It’s flexible and newcomer-friendly.\nMy Reflections This course gave me more than just language skills—it offered a buffer period during my first month in Toronto. That one-month cushion let me adjust to the city at my own pace. I learned the ins and outs of Toronto, from mastering public transit to discovering cozy study spots. Best of all, I connected with other Working Holiday Visa holders who became my friends. We bonded over shared challenges, making the transition feel less isolating.\nFor newcomers seeking a practical start and a gentle entry into Toronto life, this course is a solid pick. I’m grateful I took it—it was the perfect launchpad for my Canadian adventure.\nSpecial Thanks Julianne Studio – Your Best Friend for Studying Abroad and Chasing Dreams!\nWhen I first looked into UofT courses on my own, I noticed the price was the same as going through Julianne Studio. But the extra perks of working with Julianne made all the difference.\nBy signing up through them, I got to join the warm and welcoming Julianne family. Before coming to Canada, they held a pre-departure briefing that covered everything—customs tips, bank account setup reminders, and even an introduction to the airport pickup driver.\nAs a newcomer, I had no clue where to find good food or fun spots. But Julianne regularly hosts events and gatherings where I’ve met so many Taiwanese friends.\nIn our first month, my partner and I didn’t even know where to live—luckily, Julianne had a condo available for short-term rent (this isn’t always available since there’s only one unit, so you’d need to ask in advance if you’re interested). This gave us the perfect window to find our ideal place in Toronto.\nI’m so grateful for all their help—Julianne Studio comes highly recommended!\n","permalink":"https://chen-hung-chi.github.io/post/my-first-month-in-toronto/","summary":"UofT School of Continuing Studies’ English for Effective Communication Course Experience.","title":"My First Month in UofT"}]
