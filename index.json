This field is one I’m familiar with and passionate about, making it a natural fit for my background.\nInterview Process The first round of the interview was conducted through a digital interview format. The questions were designed to assess various aspects of my skills and experience, with a mix of different question types. Based on my notes, the breakdown of the question formats was as follows:\n2 video response questions 11 written (typed) responses 3 multiple-choice questions 1 multi-select question I recorded three specific typed-answer questions that stood out during the process:\nExplain why your background and experience would be a good fit for this job. Tell us what has been your best work achievement to this point in your career. What made this achievement important? Describe a difficult task you were faced with and how you addressed it. A Few Thoughts This was my first interview conducted entirely in English, so I felt quite nervous throughout the process. The limited preparation time—only one minute to think and a single chance to re-record—made it challenging to deliver my answers naturally, especially for the video responses. I suspect I didn’t perform as well as I could have in those sections. However, I believe my written (typed) responses were relatively strong, as I had more time to organize my thoughts. Despite this, I ultimately received a rejection email, which was disappointing. Still, the experience taught me a valuable lesson: I need to significantly improve my English-speaking skills. Moving forward, I see this as an opportunity to grow and better prepare for future interviews.\nAffirm Role Software Engineer II (Merchant Data Platform)\nHow It Started I was directly contacted by a recruiter from Affirm via LinkedIn, who invited me to submit my resume. It felt like a great opportunity, so I jumped at the chance!\nInterview Process According to what I found online, Affirm’s interview process typically consists of four stages. I’m currently in the first stage, and I’ll break it down below:\nAffirm Interview Stages Initial Screening (Current Stage)\nThis is where I am right now! It started with the recruiter reaching out on LinkedIn. After I submitted my resume, we scheduled a call to discuss my background, skills, and interest in Affirm. It’s mostly about getting to know each other and seeing if there’s a good fit. Technical Assessment\nFrom what I’ve read, this stage usually involves a coding challenge or technical exercise to evaluate my problem-solving and programming skills. I’m preparing for this next step! Technical Interviews\nThis stage seems to involve deeper technical discussions, likely with engineers from the team. I expect it’ll include coding problems, system design questions, or a dive into my past projects. Final Round (Behavioral + Team Fit)\nThe last stage appears to focus on cultural fit and behavioral questions. I might meet with senior team members or managers to talk about my experience, values, and how I’d contribute to Affirm. A Few Thoughts I’ll keep updating this as I progress through the stages. If anyone has tips for interviewing with Affirm, I’d love to hear them!
